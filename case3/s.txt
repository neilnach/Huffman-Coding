this is a file which has a lot of words in it. there are no capital letters and not much punctuation, but there is still some punctuation. you should compress this file using huffman codes, something which is really cool to implement. one big thing about this file is that it will not contain any newline characters because that simplifies the file parsing for you. there are a few commas, both here and there, so that there is a somewhat even spread. you will discover that this file will compress pretty nicely since it will follow the distribution in the s.code file.
